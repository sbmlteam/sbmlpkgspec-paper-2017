\section*{Introduction}

SBML (the Systems Biology Markup Language) is an XML-based format that has become a community standard for the storage, communication and interchange of models in systems biology~\cite{hucka2003the, waltemath2014meeting}.  The format has evolved in a community-driven fashion, with contributions from dozens of people worldwide over more than a decade and a half.  The latest generation of SBML is SBML Level~3, which is structured as a self-sufficient core and optional \emph{SBML Level~3 packages} that can be used to extend the core's syntax and semantics~\cite{hucka2015the}.  The definition of each SBML Level~3 package is written in a formal specification document that is made freely available to everyone~\cite{schreiber2015specifications, schreiber2016specifications}.  SBML packages are introduced and ratified according to an explicit SBML Development Process (\url{http://sbml.org/Documents/SBML_Development_Process}); this process also defines a template for the content that each specification document should contain.


\section*{Main Text}

\sbmlpkg{} is a LaTeX document class~\cite{lamport1994} intended to provide a common framework for writing SBML package specifications, as well as provide a uniform look and feel for the family of SBML specifications.  \sbmlpkg{} builds on a number of other commonly-available LaTeX document classes, and also defines a number of new commands, so that users of \sbmlpkg{} can focus on the essential aspects of writing clear specification documents for SBML.  Among the features provided by \sbmlpkg{} are the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item Predefined commands for defining the SBML package version, release date, home web page, and author list, to be printed on the document's front page.

\item Commands for defining SBML \emph{validation rules}.  A convention developed for the SBML specification documents is to define validation and consistency rules that must or should be satisfied by SBML files that conform to the specification; SBML package specifications likewise define their own validation and consistency rules, and the commands in \sbmlpkg{} provide the means for easily defining and formatting them.

\item Commands for formatting the names of common SBML object classes and XML primitive data types, as well as for creating new package-specific definitions.  The commands for SBML object names automatically insert hyperlinks to the sections where they are defined from wherever they are  referenced within a document.

\item Customized commands for cross-referencing sections, tables and figures; these are designed to produce \emph{both} item number and page references that are automatically hyperlinked to the appropriate locations in the finished document. They also obey some common typographical conventions (such as the use of LaTeX ties in the appropriate locations) to save authors the trouble of remembering them.

\item Commands for formatting SBML XML examples in a stylized fashion.

\item Automatic line numbering of every line in the specification document. This makes it easier to report problems and errors in specification documents, and to issue subsequent lists of errata.

\item An option to print the word \emph{DRAFT} on every page in large gray type.

\item Commands for different kinds of document notes: notices (with a hand pointer in the left margin), warnings (with a red warning sign in the left margin), and reader notes (formatted as yellow rectangular notes shown in the left margin when the document is formatted in draft mode).

\item Other miscellaneous features, such as a number of predefined color names.

\end{itemize}

To illustrate some of the features of \sbmlpkg{}, Figure~1 shows an image of a page from the user's guide.  It illustrates the general look of the document and some of the commands it provides.


\subsection*{Installation and configuration}

The use of \sbmlpkg{} should require only a recent and relatively complete installation of LaTeX2e.  It was developed and tested with the TeX Live 2011 and 2016 distributions on Mac~OS~X 10.6--10.11 system, and has been reported to work with TeX Live on Windows and Ubuntu Linux.  (For Ubuntu, make sure to install the following packages: ``\texttt{texlive}'', ``\texttt{texlive-latex-extra}'', ``\texttt{texlive-humantities}'', and ``\texttt{texlive-fonts-extra}''.)  To use \sbmlpkg, you will need to inform your copy of LaTeX where to find the file \sbmlpkgfile{} and its accompanying subdirectory ``\texttt{logos}''.  This can be done in a variety of ways.  Here are two common ones:

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Per-document installation}.  This is probably the simplest approach, although it results in multiple copies of the files.  Download the \sbmlpkg{} release from the GitHub repository (\url{\githuburl}), copy the contents (specifically, \sbmlpkgfile{} and the folder named ``\texttt{logos}'') to the folder where you keep the other files for the SBML Level~3 package specification you are authoring, and you are done.  The next time you run LaTeX in that folder, it will find the \texttt{.cls} file in the current directory and be on its merry way.

\item \emph{``Central'' installation}.  In this approach, you install \sbmlpkgfile{} in a folder where you keep other LaTeX class files, and configure your copy of LaTeX to find things there.  Configuring a TeX system in this way on Unix-type systems (Linux, etc.)\ usually requires setting the environment variable \texttt{TEXINPUTS} and possibly others.  Please consult the documentation for your TeX installation to determine how to do this.

\end{itemize}

Once \sbmlpkg{} is installed, users can write specification documents with the standard \texttt{documentclass} command in LaTeX to declare the use of the class \texttt{sbmlpkgspec}, and write their document using whatever editing environment they prefer, including online shared LaTeX editing environments.


\subsection*{Documentation}

\sbmlpkg{} comes with a complete user's guide.  Users of \sbmlpkg{} are strongly urged to read the guide; it explains everything needed to know to use the document class, and includes tips for how to make the most of it.  


\section*{Discussion}

LaTeX~\cite{lamport1994} is a popular document production system in science.  In systems biology and the SBML-using community, it is so popular that some software tools have been designed to produce LaTeX output directly~\cite{drager2009sbml2latex, shen2010sbml2tikz}.  LaTeX provides tremendous power to authors, but it is also relatively difficult to use.  Defining new styles is specially difficult, and requires arcane knowledge and significant patience.  By simplifying the requirements for producing templated documents and providing a ready-to-use LaTeX style, \sbmlpkg{} can make it easier for SBML specification authors to use LaTeX to produce documents with a uniform format.  This in turn permits authors of SBML specifications to concentrate on the technical aspects of the work.
